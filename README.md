# Hello_World
A simple place to collect thoughts and ideas as well as being a readme for my profile.

This is the first time I am actually uploading programs and files to my Git account, because of this things amy seem like a 
total mess. This is because that is true, I will be hopefully setting up my account in the following manner
  
  1. Upload everything first. This includes home work from courses (Computer Science I and II along with Data Structures Programming). This may include my Web Apllication Courses also but will for sure include free lance projects.
  
  2. Update ReadMe files for as many programs as possible (this will make it easy to come back to them for help later).
  
  3. Check programs to make sure they all work (they all should). I fthey do not simply drop them into a linux VM for simplicity and fix then re-upload. This step could take a long time but is a great oppurtunity to improve my debugging skills.
  
  4. Clean things up and make sure everything is well organized and intuitive.
  
  5. And of course....Start a new project (thinking about a ruby on rails project).
